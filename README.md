## 📖 Introduction

The project was completed during the **23-24 Fall Semester** for the SUSTech CS109 course and received a full score of **110+ (100 + Bonus)**. We actually get more than 110, but the limit for bouns is 10 points.

It was developed by a two-person team. We implemented the game logic and UI **from scratch**, without using the demo framework provided by the school. The purpose of open-sourcing this is for learning and exchange.

## 🛠️ How to Run

### 1. Environment Requirements
*   **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA (Recommended)
*   **JDK Version:** **Java 8 (1.8)** is strongly recommended.
    *   *Dev Environment:* Java 1.8.0_281.
    *   *Compatibility Note:* If you use higher versions of Java (e.g., JDK 11/17/21), you might face minor imperfections with images or animation timing (too fast/slow) due to Swing internal changes. However, the game logic remains playable.

### 2. Import Instructions (Crucial)
Please make sure to open the project correctly to load assets:
1.  Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2.  Select `File` -> `Open`.
3.  **Select the `Project` folder** (the directory containing `src`) as the project path.
    *   *Path check:* If the game launches but images are missing, please double-check your working directory.

## 💡 Project Highlights

What can you learn from this project?

1.  **Pure Swing Animation:** We built fluent animations **fully based on JFrame**. You don't need extra game engines or knowledge beyond the JavaA course to achieve smooth visuals.
2.  **Visual Design:** We designed an exquisite game appearance, which might give you ideas on how to make your UI look better.
3.  **Online Multiplayer:** We implemented a primitive online mode using Java Sockets. It demonstrates how to synchronize game states between two clients, which is a good way to earn extra points.
